### How to use:
Open two fonts and activate the plugin via **View>Show Next Font** menu item.
The ammount of masters of the fonts should be the same, in case of difference the plugin shows the first master only.

Under the right click menu you can find a menu item to swap next font view between outline and fill mode.

Also under the same menu you can sync edit views across open fonts via the "Sync edit views" item.
