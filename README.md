The ammount of masters of the fonts should be the same, in case of difference the plugin shows the first master only

### Installation:
Download the plugin, open it and restart glyphs.
For better update handling install the script via the **Window > Plugin Manager** inside Glyphs App.

### Note:
This plugin was inspired by the Show Next Master plugin from Mark Fr√∂mberg (mirque.de).
