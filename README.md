Show Next Font
==============
This plugin shows in a light orange colour the same glyph of another opened font. It could be useful for visual comparison of italics with normal styles,or different versions of the same font. 

### How to use:
Open two fonts and activate the plugin via **View>Show Next Font** menu item.
### Notes:
The ammount of masters of the fonts should be the same, in case of difference the plugin shows the first master only.
This plugin was inspired by the Show Next Master plugin from Mark Fr√∂mberg (mirque.de).
